# Next.js Instagram 2.0 app

Simple Instagram 2.0 clone - with full instagram design, upload images functionality, and like and comment functionality - without users functionality (following, profiles, etc). This project uses next auth for authorization, but makes logging in possible only with Google, for simplicity. Since it uses Google, sometimes, it fails to load profile images properly, in development, but not in production. This project is made by following tutorial by Sonny Sangha, but more additional features (pages) were added !
